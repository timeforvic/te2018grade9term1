// and includes properties of owner, withdrawalLimit, balance, and bankName
// it also has three methods that you will have to create!

// **** Problem 1: Greet the User ****
// Update the property 'owner' to be your name
// Then fill in the createGreeting method so that it will RETURN a greeting,
// including the bank name and owner name
// Our tests will then print that returned greeting to the terminal

// Then fill in the deposit method
// It needs to take an argument to add to the bankAccount's balance
// and print a success message including the amount deposited

// **** Problem 2 Tests ****

// **** Problem 3: Withdraw Monies ****
// Then fill in the withdrawal method
// This one requires a bit more logic than the first two!
// This method will take an argument to withdraw from the bank Account
// If it doesn't exceed the withdrawalLimit and the balance and is above 0, remove the amount and print a success message
// Otherwise do not remove the amount and print a failure messages

// **** Problem 4: Object Methods ****
// Write code that represents any object you like. Your object should have at
// least four properties and four methods. At least two of your methods should
// utilize the "this" keyword to refer to properties, or call other methods,
// owned by the object.


// Test all of your object's methods below.
